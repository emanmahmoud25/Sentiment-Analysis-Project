#### Objective
The primary aim of this project is to analyze tweets related to airlines and classify them into sentiment categories: positive, neutral, or negative.

#### Key Steps Involved

1. **Data Import**: 
   - The project begins by importing essential libraries such as `pandas`, `numpy`, and `matplotlib`. It then loads the dataset containing the tweets for analysis.

2. **Data Exploration**:
   - Initial exploration involves displaying the first few rows of the dataset and checking the distribution of sentiments and reasons for negative sentiments.

3. **Data Cleaning**:
   - This step includes removing unnecessary columns and cleaning the text data by eliminating special characters, usernames, and stop words to prepare the data for analysis.

4. **Sentiment Counting**:
   - The project calculates the total counts of positive, neutral, and negative sentiments based on the cleaned dataset.

5. **Visualization**:
   - Visual representations, such as plots, are created to illustrate the distribution of sentiments, providing an intuitive understanding of the data.
